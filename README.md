# Google-Stock-prediction-_-RNN--LSTM
Build the models to predict the Google stock price 


Objective: We have the chosen dataset from Yahoo finance which available from 2004 to 2020. Our ultimate goal is to forecast the stock price on 60 based on the parameter is given in the Dataset by trains them using data from the last 60 days.          

Outcome: We were able to build the models to predict the Google stock price ranges in from 60 days by using influential factors for the decision so that we can produce efficient and precise stock price predictions.
